# Qiskit :
Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. Additionally, several domain specific application APIâ€™s exist on top of this core module.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.
# We are the people of "five" from 6CAI-02 did a mini-project based on quantum given by our faculty.
